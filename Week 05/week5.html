        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in the code</li>
                    <li>Errors are usually caused by three types of things <br> 1. System Errors, a problem with the system or external devices<br> 2. Programmer Errors, program contains invalid syntax, typos, or faulty logic<br> 3. User Error, user has entered
                        data in incorrectly which program cannot handle
                    </li>
                    <li>Exceptions are errors that get returned values that can be used to then fix the error</li>
                    <li>Exceptions have stack traces which are the path of errors leading back to the root of the issue and helps to identify what went wrong</li>
                    <li>Warnings are errors that aren't enough to cause the program to crash but will display a message of the issue</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - The Importance of Testing and Debugging</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors can happen both silently or loudly</li>
                    <li>A developers job is to ensure that a failure is visible so that it can be caught and corrected</li>
                    <li>As such testing must be done many times over to ensure that as many bugs and errors are caught as possible</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - Strict Mode</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strict mode is a way to run a program that produces more errors</li>
                    <li>It does so by even taking programming styles considered to be in poor taste and consider them errors</li>
                    <li>It also encourages and promotes clearer and more refined code because of the strict guidelines</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - Feature Detection</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Because languages like JavaScript are constantly being updated and evolving there can be features that are not yet supported in certain browsers</li>
                    <li>To prevent an issue there is the feature detection method which detects if a method or object exists first and then if it does will continue with the assigned code block</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - Debugging in the Browser</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Debugging is the process of finding bugs or errors and then dealing with them</li>
                    <li>Debugging needs to be done piece by piece to ensure all the code is properly functioning, which is where breakpoints are handy</li>
                    <li>Breakpoints are where the programmer chooses to halt the progress of the code to view the different values</li>
                    <li>There are many tools and methods to help create breakpoints, such as the alert() method, the console object to log events, and debugging tools in browsers</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3><em>Chapter 10 - Error Objects</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
